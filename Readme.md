# Scoring

## Overall Rank
40% Standardized Dataset Score Rank  
20 % Standardized Category Rank  
15 % Standardized Category Variance Rank  
10% Standardized Dataset Rank  
5 % Standardized Formats Rank  
5% Standardized last update rank  
5 % Standardized category rank  

### Dataset Score

The dataset score consists of the following:  
Each dataset is assigned a score. The perfect score for a dataset is 3.   
The sum of all dataset scores is divided by the number of datasets to get the resulting score  

_Example_

10 Datasets with a perfect score of 3 would result in a score if 3 (10\*3/10)

Afterwards all dataset scores are rank among all cities. So the city with the best score is in 1st place and so forth.

### Category Score

The catagory score is a score of maximum 1 one. 1 point is awared if the city has a dataset in each category. 0,5 point if a dataset in at least half of the categories exists. 

### Category Variance Score

This score computes the variance for the amount of datasets per category. If a city has a lot of datasets in just one category a low variance is the result and vice versa. A low variance is what we score highest. 

### Dataset Score

The more datset the city has the higher the score and the rank.

### Formats Rank

The more formats the more points and rank.

### Standardization
Each rank is standadized.  
The place is divided by the maximum rank (ties are allowed) and multiplied by 100.

_Example_

Rank: 1  
Max Rank: 100  
Standadized Rank: 1  

Rank: 10  
Max Rank: 80  
Resulting Rank: 12,5
